    <big>DRONE A USEFUL GADGET</big>
    <p>Drones have two basic functions: flight mode and navigation.

To fly, drones must have a power source, such as a battery or fuel. They also commonly have rotors, propellers or wings and a frame. The frame of a drone is typically made of a lightweight, composite material to reduce weight and increase maneuverability.

Drones with propellers typically have four double-bladed propellers that stem off four arms connected to the frame. They generate lift using motors that rapidly spin the propellers. Drones that use wings, on the other hand, rely on the forward movement of the aircraft to push the wings through the air to generate lift.

Drones require a controller, which lets the operator use remote controls to launch, navigate and land the aircraft -- all while the pilot remains on the ground. The controllers communicate with the drone using radio waves, such as Wi-Fi. Drones also commonly have a camera onboard, which streams what it's seeing to the controller held by the pilot.

Some drones can fly on a set course automatically using a combination of obstacle avoidance sensors and GPS. A common implementation of this to modernaise world</p>

<p>Navigational systems, such as GPS, are typically housed in the nose of a drone. The GPS on a drone communicates its precise location to the controller. An onboard altimeter can communicate altitude information as well as help keep the drone at a specific altitude if the controller designates one.

Drones can be equipped with sensors, including ultrasonic, laser or lidar distance sensors, time-of-flight sensors, chemical sensors and stabilization and orientation sensors. Visual sensors offer still and video data. Red, green and blue sensors collect standard visual RGB wavelengths, and multispectral sensors collect visible and nonvisible wavelengths, such as infrared and ultraviolet. Accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, barometers and GPS are also common drone features.

For example, thermal sensors enable surveillance and security applications, such as livestock monitoring and heat-signature detection. Hyperspectral sensors help identify minerals and vegetation, and are ideal for use in crop health, water quality and surface composition.

Some drones use sensors to detect obstacles and avoid collisions. Initially, these sensors were designed to detect objects in front of the drone. Some drones now provide obstacle detection in five directions: front, back, belo</p>
